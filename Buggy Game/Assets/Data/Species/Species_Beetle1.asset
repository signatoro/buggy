  preCaughtDescription: 
  postCaughtDescription: 'The Woodstuck Beetle is a common but careful bug. They
    often congregate in large groups around fallen or rotting trees. While large
    in number, they are small in heroics and will run away at the slightest sound.
    They can be identified by their tendency to hang around fallen log. '
