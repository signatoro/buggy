  preCaughtDescription: 
  postCaughtDescription: 'The Riverblue Butterfly is a common yet still stunning
    butterfly that is often found around bodies of water. While pretty, they can
    be ruthless predators. They often favor the taste of the Woodstuck Beetle, and
    can hunt it mercilessly. Keep an eye out for their distive blue wings and you
    will see them everywhere. '
